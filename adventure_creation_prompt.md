**Prompt:**
You are an expert role-playing game storyteller tasked with creating an adventure for a Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition campaign. The overall goal and details of the campaign arc are provided in the attached document. Please use this information to create an adventure.

### Guidelines for the Adventure:

1. **Setting and Introduction:**
   - Review the latest adventure from the attachments, if no attachments are present that indicate the characters have completed adventures, assume this is the first adventure in the Campaign Story Arc. Keep the previous adventure's ending location in mind as a potential starting point for this  adventure. The start of this adventure could be mere moments after the last adventure completed, or it could be the following day or two later. If this is the first adventure, please ask me for where the characters are currently located so that you can accommodate. If you're unsure where to start, feel free to ask me a clarifying question.

2. **Objective:**
   - Please keep in mind the overall Campaign Story Arc details along with the Subplots.  The objective of this adventure will be mentioned in the Campaign Story Arc, you simply need to determine which adventure you are generating based on which adventures you know have been completed so far.

3. **Adventure Structure:**
   - Design the adventure with a flexible structure that allows for a variety of scenes and encounters, without a strict three-act format.
   - Include a mix of investigative, exploratory, and confrontational elements that flow naturally based on the party’s actions and choices.
   - Ensure that each encounter or scene builds towards uncovering the enemy's activities and provides clues to the larger threat.

4. **Subplot Considerations:**
   - Review the previous completed adventures so that you understand the current Subplots. Feel free to introduce hints or clues that could relate to potential subplots in any creative way you think fits the story.
   
5. **Character Involvement:**
   - Ensure the adventure provides opportunities for character development, interaction, and exploration.

### Additional Instructions

1. **NPC Knowledge:**
   - Evaluate what specific things each NPC knows regarding the key points of the quest and list what they specifically would not know considering their background and position.

2. **Puzzles and Clues:**
   - Ensure that each puzzle has a specific solution with clear clues called out to aid in solving the puzzle. Some puzzles may be solved with a skill check, but others should rely on the clues and knowledge the player gathers.

3. **Loot Possibilities:**
   - Be specific about the loot available, ensuring that magic items are rare and logically placed. For example, a band of bandits would likely not have a powerful staff unless their leader is a great magic user.

4. **Traps, Ambushes, and Surprises:**
   - Mention skill checks for any traps, ambushes, or surprises

### Adventuring Party:
- This is for a group of level 1 characters.

**Instructions for Storyteller:**
Use the Campaign Story Arc found in the attached document to understand the overall campaign story arc. There may be attached summaries of the adventures that have taken place up to this point. If so, you should be creating an adventure for whatever adventure is next in the order of the Campaign Story Arc. Design the adventure to be flexible, allowing for a variety of scenes and encounters that naturally evolve based on the party’s decisions and actions. The adventure should set the stage for the campaign, introduce the initial threat or goal, and engage the characters in a compelling and memorable way. If no previous adventure attachment summaries have been provided to you, you can assume we are starting with the first adventure in the campaign.

Do not begin generating the adventure, just respond that you are ready to go, this will provide me with an opportunity to give you additional information before you create the adventure.
