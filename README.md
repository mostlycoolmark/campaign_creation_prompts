###Campaign and Advenutre Creation Prompts for ChatGPT

This repository contains two prompts that can be used to help you create a Dungeons and Dragons campaign.

***Campaign Creation Prompt:***
This prompt should be run to create the campaign overview. The campaign overview will include an overarching objective along with a very brief descripion of the adventures and the key events. Additionally, it will create a number of subplots that are integrated with the campaign, and the names of important groups and npcs that will be used in the campaign.

***Advenutre Creation Prompt:***
When you run the adventure creation prompt it is important to provide the campaign ovewview you have generated above. The adventure creation prompt will look at the campaign overview to create the appropriate adventure. Each adventure will include a number of scenes, along with descriptions and objectives for what should happen during the adventure. Additionally, traps, puzzles, and loot suggestions are listed.


###How to use these prompts effectively:

Prior to generating your campaign, you can provide the prompt with additional details:
- A list of the players, their levels, backgrounds, and classes
- Description of the setting, as broad or specific as you want, including important landmarks
- NPCs that he players may interact with, including quest givers, important characters, etc
- Additionally, you can always ask ChatGPT what other details it could use to create a good campaign

Prior to creating the adventure, you can provide the prompt with same additional details above, along with:
- A summary of the previous adventures that the players have had. For example, if the players have completed the first adventure in the campaign, create a document that includes a sumamary of all events, NPCs, loot, etc.


***Additional notes for tweaking your adventures:***
- You may want to review the enemies that are generated to be sure that they match your campaign. If the campaign is all under water, it may not make sense that the players are going to be fighting a pack of wolves.
- Be sure to review the traps and look for additional details of where the traps are.
- You will likely want to tweak the puzzles that are generated to have a specific problem and solution. The prompt may simply generate "the players need to solve a puzzle involving runes to open the door." Ask clarifying questions of what the solution is and ensure that it matches the theme of what you're going for.

***Additional notes for campaign generation:***
- Ask for more ideas or for clarification of items in the campaign document. For example:
  - The players are trying to stop a necromancer from summoning an army of skeletons: what is the necromancer's motivation? how is he summoning so many skeeltons? if the necromancer has allies, why are they his allies?
  - The players need to prevent orcs from invading: where did the orcs come from? why are they attacking? what will they do if they win? what will they do if they lose? what does the average orc think of their orders to attack?
  - The players must stop an evil druid from poisoning a well that will cause everyone who drinks it to turn into a cat: what is the druid's reason for making people cats? what magic is being used to make people cats? does a person retain their faculties as a cat, or do they truly become a feline? why would the druid want to change people into cats instead of some other creature?

Asking follow up questions for ideas will allow ChatGPT to give you a lot more detail for your campaign. It may even affect the overall campaign structure, as you discover additional motiviations for your villians or new storylines for the players to explore.
